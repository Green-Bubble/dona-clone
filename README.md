# 📃 ️Dona Clone

This project is a clone of [Dona](https://dona.ai/), which is a To-Do List application focused on design.

I've always liked their design and decided to recreate their app using CSS - Styled Components.

This is kinda also of a refactor of an old To-Do App I've made, which you can see [here](https://github.com/antoniopataro/todo-app).

Feel free to share thoughts to me and get in touch.

### ⚙️ Technologies
